# [WeAreOpenSource](https://weareopensource.me) Node

### Node / Express / Mongoose / Sequelize

## Presentation
This project a stack Node that can be ran as a standalone application. Or in a fullstack, like this example, [MEANie](https://github.com/weareopensource/MEANie). We are actually in Beta.

| Subject | Node
| ------- | --------
| **Node.js**  | v8
| **DB: SQL**  | Sequelize ORM
| **DB: Mongo**  | Mongoose
| **Deliver**  | Docker & Docker-compose
| **CI**  | Travis
| **Testing: Tools** | request, ava
| **Testing: Tests Automation** | separates tasks to unit tests, integration tests
| **Testing: ExpressJS** | gulp instantiates a real ExpressJS API service
| **Testing: Seed** | seed tasks resets the db/models to clear data and is separated to own gulp task
| **Developer: Community**  | uses `commitizen` to streamline commit guidelines
| **Developer: Debug**  | uses v8's builtin `debug` and `inspect` optionse

Planned:

| Subject  | Node
| -------  | --------
| **CI**  | Travis, Gitlab-ci
| **Config** | dotenv, convict
| **Documentation: API**  | Swagger
| **Documentation: Code**  | Docco
| **Developer: Lint** | Standard JS

## [Demo](http://meanie.weareopensource.me)  (This Node stack is used for this demonstration of MEANie fullstack)

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:
* Git - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* Node.js (7.x, 8.x) - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Installation
It's straightforward
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/weareopensource/node.git && cd Node
$ npm i
```

## Running Your Application

### Development
* Run `gulp` for a dev server. Available at `http://localhost:3000/`.

### Production
* Run `gulp prod` for a prod server. Available at `http://localhost:8443/`

## History

This work is based on [MEAN.js](http://meanjs.org) and more precisely on a fork of the developers named [Riess.js](https://github.com/lirantal/Riess.js). The work being stopped we wished to take it back, we want to create updated stack with same mindset "simple", "easy to use". The toolbox needed to start projects.

## [We Are Open Source, Who we are ?](https://weareopensource.me)
Today, we dreams to create Backs/Fronts, aligns on feats, in multiple languages, in order to allow anyone to compose fullstack on demand (React, Angular, VusJS, Node, Nest, Swift, Go).
Feel free to discuss, share other kind of bricks, and invite whoever you want with this mindset to come help us.
